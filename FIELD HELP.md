Glossary of Terms & Acronyms

CapEx (Capital Expenditures): The total upfront cost incurred to develop and construct the project until it reaches the Commercial Operation Date (COD). This includes all costs for land, permits, engineering, equipment (panels, inverters, racking), and construction (labor).
COD (Commercial Operation Date): The contractual milestone when the project is fully constructed, tested, and certified to be complete and "online." It marks the end of construction (CapEx) and the beginning of the project's operational life (OpEx and revenue generation) under the PPA.
DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio): A key metric used by lenders to determine the project's ability to repay its loan. It is calculated for a specific period (e.g., one year) as:
$DSCR = \frac{\text{Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS)}}{\text{Total Debt Service (Principal + Interest)}}$
Lenders require this to be above 1.0x (e.g., 1.25x) as a safety buffer.
EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction): This refers to the primary contractor responsible for the design, sourcing of all equipment, and construction of the project. An "EPC Contract" is a "turnkey" agreement where the contractor agrees to deliver the completed project for a fixed price by a fixed date.
EYA (Energy Yield Assessment): A formal, bankable report prepared by an engineer that models the project's expected annual electricity production (in MWh). It uses specific site data (solar irradiance, weather), equipment (panels, inverters), and system design to forecast output, typically providing P50, P90, and P99 estimates.
FID (Final Investment Decision): The final, formal approval by the project's equity investors (sponsors) to commit capital and proceed with construction. This decision is only made after the PPA, EPC, and financing agreements are all finalized.
IE (Independent Engineer): A third-party technical expert hired by the lenders (but paid for by the project/developer) to review all aspects of the project. They validate the EYA, project budget (CapEx), construction schedule, and key contracts (PPA, EPC) to ensure the project is technically and financially sound.
IRR (Internal Rate of Return): The primary metric used by equity investors to measure the profitability of their investment. It is the discount rate at which the Net Present Value (NPV) of all project cash flows (negative and positive) equals zero. It is expressed as a percentage (e.g., 8-12% IRR).
ITC (Investment Tax Credit): A U.S. federal tax incentive that allows the project owner to receive a tax credit equal to a percentage (e.g., 30%) of the project's CapEx. This is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability, making it extremely valuable and a key driver of tax equity financing.
kW (Kilowatt): A unit of power (capacity), equal to 1,000 watts. Utility-scale projects are measured in Megawatts (MW), which are 1,000 kW.
LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy): A metric used to compare the lifetime cost of different generation technologies. It represents the breakeven price ($$/MWh) at which the project must sell its energy to cover its lifetime costs (CapEx, OpEx, and financing) and achieve a target return.
LLCR (Loan Life Coverage Ratio): A lender metric, similar to DSCR, but measured over the entire life of the loan. It is the ratio of the Net Present Value of cash flow (discounted at the loan's interest rate) during the loan term to the outstanding debt balance.
MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System): The U.S. tax depreciation rulebook. For solar projects, it allows owners to "accelerate" depreciation, writing off the bulk of the asset's value in the first 5-6 years. This creates large "paper losses" that tax equity investors use to offset their other taxable income.
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions): In this context, it refers to the sale of the project (an "asset sale") from the original developer to a long-term owner/operator, which often happens either right at COD or after a few years of stable operation.
MWh (Megawatt-hour): A unit of energy (production), equal to 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh). A project with a 10 MW capacity running at full power for one hour produces 10 MWh of energy. PPAs are priced in $$/MWh.
NPV (Net Present Value): A core financial metric that calculates the total value of the project in today's dollars. It sums all future cash flows (positive and negative) after discounting them by a specific rate (the "discount rate," often the investor's required rate of return). A positive NPV means the project is profitable.
NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory): A U.S. government research lab that is a primary source for foundational solar irradiance data (e.g., the National Solar Radiation Database) used in early-stage feasibility models.
NTP (Notice to Proceed): The formal, contractual notice the project owner gives to the EPC contractor to "start work." This is the official kickoff for construction and typically happens immediately after achieving Financial Close (when all the money is in the bank).
O&M (Operations and Maintenance): The ongoing activities required to keep the solar farm running efficiently after it is built. This includes panel cleaning, vegetation management, inverter repairs, and performance monitoring. It is the largest component of OpEx.
OpEx (Operating Expenditures): The recurring, annual costs to operate the project after COD. This includes the O&M contract, land lease payments, property taxes, insurance, and asset management fees.
PPA (Power Purchase Agreement): The most critical project contract. It is the long-term (e.g., 15-25 year) sales agreement with a creditworthy offtaker (like a utility) who agrees to purchase all electricity produced by the project at a fixed, often escalating, price. This contract is what makes the project's revenue "bankable."
PLCR (Project Life Coverage Ratio): A lender metric, similar to LLCR, but measured over the entire life of the project (e.g., 30 years), not just the loan term (e.g., 10-15 years). It gives the lender a view of the project's total cash flow relative to the debt.
PTC (Production Tax Credit): An alternative U.S. federal tax incentive to the ITC. It provides a per-kilowatt-hour ($$/kWh) tax credit based on the energy produced (not the cost to build) for the first 10 years of operation. It is more common for wind projects, while solar almost always uses the ITC.
PV (Photovoltaic): The technology that converts sunlight directly into DC (direct current) electricity using semiconductor cells. This is the "solar panel" technology.
W (Watt): The base unit of electrical power. Project CapEx is often benchmarked in "dollars per watt" ($$/W).
